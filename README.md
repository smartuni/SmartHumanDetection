# SmartHumanDetection

SmartHumanDetection is a Software, wich detects if a human or a pet is in the Room.

This software is based on RIOT operating system (https://www.riot-os.org/),the main goal of the project is to control the functions of the house by using a microconrollers and sensors.

In order to achieve this we need to work by the IoT network, where the electronics devices (Arduino, Raspberry pi ) are goinig to be connected by wires and communicate by MQTT protocol.

Two main sensors are going to be needed to establish this:

Photodiode-Laser sensor: The principle is to detect any object enters the room, however to distinguish the humans from the pets, a specific hight must be chosen. 
Infrared sensor: This sensor is responsible for detecting the presence of the human, to decide which room to turn the light on (For example).
